# Quiz #2 - Task 1

The program performs the following tasks:

- Initializes two predefined lists:
  - `list1`: A list of integers representing indices.

- Processes `list1` and `list2` to create a third list, `list3`.  
  For each element `x` in `list1`, it calculates the index `(2 * x - 1)` to retrieve an element from `list2`.  
  These retrieved elements are collected in `list3`.

- Prints the contents of `list3`.
